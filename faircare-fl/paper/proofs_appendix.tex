\section{Proof Sketches}
\paragraph{T1} Weighting clients by loss$^q$ emphasizes high-loss clients; smoothness ensures descent on worst loss.
\paragraph{T2} DP/EO depend on TP/FP/FN/TN counts; aggregated counts yield unbiased estimates without raw data.
\paragraph{T3} Momentum SGD with $\beta<1$ and bounded gradients converges to stationary points under standard conditions.
\paragraph{T4} Blending worst-case objectives with coefficient $\lambda_A$ bounds excess worst-client loss by $\mathcal{O}(1/\lambda_A)$.
